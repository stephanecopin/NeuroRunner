# NeuroRunner

NeuroRunner is a company dedicated to providing athletes with cognitive exercises to help them achieve their maximum potential. According the the Navy SEALs, when athletes and cadets feel overcome by fatigue, they are usually only at their 40% threshold. NeuroRunner provides a series of exercises that help users familiarize themselves with this sensation, become accustomed to it, and inevitably push themselves further than they thought possible. 

The screens and code presented in this repository are examples of how the instruments for NeuroRunner were developed, and are not representative of the full scope of the app.
